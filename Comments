These are comments using C++ Code in a code block.

REMINDER: The way comments are written in C++ is like the following below:
1) Single-Line-Comment = //
2) Multi-Line-Comment = /* */

Single-Line-Comments, are used to disable a single line of code, making it stop from working or running whenever the program is executed.
Multi-Line-Comments, are used to disable an entire block of code or just the entire script of code in general from running.

/*

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "I will Comment this out"; // This is now DISABLED.
}

*/ // The entire code block is now DISABLED. (will not run whatsoever)
